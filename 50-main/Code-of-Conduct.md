# Code of Conduct

## Conflict Resolution:
In the event of a problem, team members are expected to address the issue internally. If the issue is not resolved
within 24 hours, the issue will be escalated to the teacher (Michel).

## Project Hierarchy:
No team member holds higher authority over the project. 
If a higher authority over the project is required, the teacher is said higher authority.

The Scrum Master is Nick Ridder.<br>
The Client communication manager is Lisa Aldera.<br>
The Repository manager is Martin Dimitrov.<br>
The internal product owner is Stoyan Hristozov.<br>
The documentation manager is Hyeri Lee. <br>
The code quality manager is Filip Krylecki. <br>

## Communication:
Team members experiencing challenges are encouraged to communicate openly with the team, seeking assistance to
prevent project slowdowns. Additionally, proactive communication should extend to sharing insights, updates, and
potential roadblocks.
Team members are expected to be available on discord from at least 10:00 - 12:00 & 13:00 - 15:00 on working days (this rule does not apply for days where people have work). Any official team communication will take place on discord or in person. Team members will meet every Wednesday at 18:30 and Friday at 19.

## Strike System:
In addition to any rules set by the teacher(s) for the subject, each team member agrees to the following (additional) rules:

### Attendance
In the case of train delays or illness, the team should be informed as soon as possible. If this does not happen, the teammate receives a warning. After three such warnings, the team will issue a request to strike.

In the case of train delays, the acceptable delay is over 15 minutes in advance.

In the case of illness, the accaptable delay is one hour. If possible, the team-member should be available and attend any meetings online.

In the case of missing attendence for any other reason, this will need to be discussed at minimum 48 hours in advance.

### Code quality
The use of AI to generate a solution is disallowed. AI is allowed to be used to answer questions about code, or to generate single lines of code. If multiple lines of code are generated using AI and copy-pasted, the team member wil receive a strike. Every individual team member is responsible for any code they submit, whether written by themselves or using AI.

Any merge requests need to be approved by at least 1 team member. If a branch gets merged without approval, the team member receives a strike.

No member will work directly on the main branch after the initial commit. If any code is submitted directly to the main branch, the team member receives a strike.

For every feature, a new branch is used. If this rule is not followed, the member receives a warning. After three warnings, the member gets a strike. 

If a team member is stuck on an issue for over 3 days, the team should get notified of the issues the member is facing. If a member is stuck on an issue for over a week, another team member will help with the issue.

### Documentation
Each team member will document the time spent in the shared Excel sheet after each coding session, rounded to the half hour. 

Every function written by a team member will be documented. This documentation will be formatted in the following way:
At the start of a file:
```
/*
 * Author: Your name
 * Created on: Current date in day-month-year 24H-Time
 * 
 * Function
*/
```
Example:
```
/*
 * Author: Nick Ridder
 * Created on: 5-6-2024 12:10
 * 
 * Prints hello world to the console
*/
```

Above each function:
```
/**
 * @brief A brief summary
 * 
 * @param Parameter
 * @return Return value
/*
```
Example:
```
/**
 * @brief Prints the inputted text to the console
 * 
 * @param string Text to be printed
*/
```

Inline comments will be used where the team member finds necessary, but are not required. 

If a team member fails to add these comments, they will receive a warning. Three such warnings will result in a strike. 

### Each team member needs to sign this Code of Conduct to work on the project.<br>One copy will be kept between the members, and one copy is given to the teacher.
